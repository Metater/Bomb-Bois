    // clues about code mem address
    // based on serial number there is a decimal memory location with defusal code
    // write code convert memory address to hex and write code to copy that code
    // and enter the code

    // clues about
    // another type could iterate through memory searching for the code
    // you could use binary search or brute force search
    // depending on if memory is ordered or not

    // one is just copy code from memory location

    // write assembly code

    // or higher level code later when you unlock a better computer????

    // you have to write out code bits to different pins

    // some may be an 8 bit code, 16 bit, 24, 32
    // you have to split the code and write bytes of the code

    // you also have the option to brute force the code, it just will take longer

    // you have to do a few wire cuts before you can run code on the thing

    // cut the wire for the memory hasher

    // if memory hash changes, boom????

    // idk

    // memory hash timer, you have to check it with your program to make sure you do things with memory when it is off??
